# Requirements
- PHP 7.2
- Slim framework 4.5
- Imagick

# Directory structure
Assume `www/html/` is the web root context.

- `www/html/public` : public database
- `www/html/api` : PHP files for API
- `www/private` : private directory (users)

# Development server on Ubuntu
With a default Ubuntu, you may need : 
`sudo apt install php-xdebug libapache2-mod-php php-gd php-mbstring php-xml php-imagick`

# FAQ

- Why not using a true CMS on a web hosting package ?
Value for money. A true CMS embeds too much unwanted features, such as public comments. Calendar events are not shipped with a CMS, and require a plugin.

- And a hosted CMS ?
I prefer a domain name, instead of mysite.company.com

- Why JSON files over a SQL database ?
Some entry level offers don't have any database, shipped with 10MB of file storage, such as a domain name package.
In future plans, with the growing data, the database may become useful. For now, we have 10-20 news per year, and roughly the same for calendar events.
